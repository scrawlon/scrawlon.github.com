Team Trailers was a full site migration/redesign to WordPress + WooCommerce. One piece of this would be the trailers catalog page. The client wanted a frontend to their WooCommerce products with dynamic text search and filtering by category, brand, size and price range.

I built the trailers catalog frontend with BackboneJS. It updates dynamically when a user interacts with the search and filter options. On the backend, custom WordPress queries provide access to the product database.
