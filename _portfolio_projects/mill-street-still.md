For this project, I was asked to create a floating navigation menu.
On page load, the navigation menu would appear at the bottom of the screen.
If a user scrolled
down the menu would move float up to the top of the page and stay there.
The content below would flow under as the user continued to scroll.
If the user then scrolls back down, the process would reverse until the menu was
at the bottom of the screen again.

I spent most of my development time working out the implementation on paper.
In the end, I wrote a jQuery script to make it work.
