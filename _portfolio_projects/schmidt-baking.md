For this project, I was asked to work on the product pages. The lead
designer had an approved mockup, and I needed to figure out how to make the promised
features work as expected.

On the
<a
href="http://schmidtbaking.com/products/"
title="Schmidt Baking: Products" target="\_blank">main products page</a>,
there would be an animated
menu featuring small photos of Schmidt's bread products. Below that would be
info on a featured product.
Clicking a link from the menu would open the product details page.
Here there'd be a large photo, a description, an FAQ, 'Health and Wellness' info
and 'Nutrition Facts'.

My first challenge was to create a new WordPress post type that included
custom input fields for menu photos, the FAQ, etc. I also needed to ensure that
the custom data entry interface wasn't overly complex, and wouldn't require
any special instructions beyond our standard WordPress training.

Once I had the backend in place, I coded the PHP templates and worked with the
designer to tweak the CSS and JavaScript on the frontend.
