Quite a few designers, developers, copywriters and SEO specialists
have collaborated on this web site. It may be the most important example of the work
done by employees at Compulse Integrated Marketing. This is the page that
contains the
<a href="http://compulse.com/our-work/"
title="Compulse portfolio page" target="\_blank">Compulse portfolio page</a>,
so oddly enough this design matters more than the sites in the portfolio.

For my part, I worked on the WordPress
<a
href="http://compulse.com/category/blog/"
title="Blog page templates"
target="\_blank">Blog page templates</a>, porting design mockups
into code. Some of my other work is still being reviewed in the Staging
environment. I'll write more when the pages are added or updated.
