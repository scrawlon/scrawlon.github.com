<h2>Scrawlon Is...</h2>
<p>
  ...the home of web developer, Scott McGrath (ME!).
  Read the <a href="/blog" title="Blog - Scrawlon">Blog</a> for
  programming tutorials and tech-related posts.

  examples and detailed writeups of recent web projects.

<p>
  The name "Scrawlon" came from one of my first web projects, a phone-based
  note-taking app from the pre-smartphone era. The idea was to text myself
  short notes that could be searched later on - kind of a cross between
  Twitter and Evernote. The app never fully materialized, but I liked the name so
  much that I've taken it as my online moniker.
