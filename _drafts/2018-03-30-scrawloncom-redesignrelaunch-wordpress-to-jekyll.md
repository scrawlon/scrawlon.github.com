## Background
There was a time when my web presence comprised of
a few unfinished Ruby apps on Heroku and a
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
blog on
[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
Apparently, that was enough to get me hired as a Junior Web Developer at
[Compulse Integrated Marketing](https://compulse.com/){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

When I joined Compulse,
they were transitioning from their own custom web framework to the popular
[WordPress](https://wordpress.com/){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
PHP-based framework.
I had zero experience with WordPress or PHP, and not enough time in
the work day to learn them "on the job". In order to get ramped up ASAP, I
decided to move my blog to WordPress, and work on it after hours as much as
possible.

## Why leave WordPress?

but where's the challenge?

Three years later, I'd worked on more WordPress projects than I could remember,
and discovered nearly all there was to know. Coding on WordPress,
was my comfort zone. That's great for productivity, but where's the challenge?

In order to grow beyond the needs of my employer, it was time to move away
from WordPress in my off hours. It might seem counterintuitive to return to
Jekyll, considering the goal, but a static site generator makes great blank
slate. It's just Html, CSS and Javascript. Instead of backend code, where most
WordPress dev lives, I'd be focusing on design and frontend development.

Another plus -- Github Pages is free. Between DigitalOcean
hosting and premium WordPress themes, I was paying about $20 a month for a
site with monthly views close to zero.

## The Redesign

I've always been a developer. Design is a different beast, with a different set
of skills. Fortunately, Compulse has a great team of web designers, and I've
picked up a bit of an eye for what looks good.

I always meant this site to portray a "developer" vibe. The old site went
literal, with a stock image of a computer monitor on a desk. The new design
has a more abstract cyberpunk vibe --

This true purpose of this website has always been to "wow" future employers.
I need to show my best work here -- in the design of the site and in the
content.




I had done a couple projects with
[BackboneJS](http://backbonejs.org/){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
and it really piqued my interest. At the time, a lot was happening in frontend dev.
JavaScript could power everything from animation to real-time communication.

Since

[React](https://reactjs.org/){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
was the new big thing.


 Compulse had adapted SASS and
JavaScript with a Gulp build process. As time went on, we began incorporating
more interactive UI code.
I'd worked with SASS, jQuery a lot, and
even done incorporated BackboneJS into a couple projects.

For posterity, here are other factors that may have driven the decisions to
switch back to Jekyll:

1. Recurring Costs:
  * WordPress: $10/month for DigitalOcean web hosting + $89/year for the Divi
theme
  * Jekyll: Free Github Pages hosting


Here are the reasons I
A few months after I started, management decided to
broaden their client-base. We were taking on new clients from small
businesses around the country. All projects going forward would be built on
WordPress, using the Divi theme. NONE OF US had any WordPress experience...

In order to ramp up my WordPress knowledge, I decided to migrate my Jekyll
blog to WordPress. I could continue working on my own projects in my free
time, and I'd be learning WP at the same time.

## What's wrong with WordPress?



I used WordPress all day, every day -- at work and at home. I became an
expert in short order
The biggest reason I stopped working on my website is burnout. After using
the same framework and plugins day-in-day-out for 40 hours a week, I just
didn't have the drive to continue in my off time. I wanted to learn and use
other tools/frameworks.

Here are the pros/cons list for WordPress

Shortly after I started, my employer made a big change.
We were changing frameworks. New website builds would use WordPress.
No one on
the team, aside from our manager, had any experience with WordPress. As the
sole developer at the time, I had to get ramped up quickly.



A few months after I was hired, we began building sites on WordPres

Why did I abandon my website -- the site that should have been the primary
example of my knowledge and skills?

Though meant to be the prime example of my skills and
knowledge, it remained unchanged for over a year.

As a developer, inspiration can be fleeting.  
There's often sense of inertia before diving into a project, even in

For best results,
I strive for zero distractions.
Noise-cancelling headphones on, facing a blank wall in a private office,
code flows freely from my fingers.
