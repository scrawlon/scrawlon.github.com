Amazon Alexa is an amazing technology. Once I got my hands on an Echo, I had to
try my hand at Alexa skill development. Amazon's
[online library of code and tutorials][1]{:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
on Github  made it fairly easy to get started.

To get my feet wet, I chose to build a game. The concept was a random
'yes, no, maybe' answer generator, like an updated version of the classic
'Magic 8 Ball' game. It would be conversational, and the answers would have
context from the questions. If a user asks, "Will I be famous?",
the skill would respond, "The Hive Mind believes that you will".
If asked, "Is NASCAR a real sport", the answer might be,
"The Hive Mind believes that it is not".
