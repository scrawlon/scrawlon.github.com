      A brief bit about me: I studied journalism at university. 
      I work in the engineering dept. at a network television station.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've always wanted to be a programmer. Ever since we were allowed to tinker with
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a> in a junior high computer class. Unfortunately, I was born at a time
      when computers were only for the most mathetically-inclined whiz-kids. I and most others were barred
      from the computer lab soon after. It wasn't for us.
    </p>

      I believed that until the recent appearance of free onilne education sites like:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm">MIT Open Courseware</a>
        <li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/">P2PU</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thankfully, I and probably millions of others have found and explored an interest in programming this way.
      It's an awesome time to be a learner, but before these self-contained, auto-graded, video-lectured virtual
      class rooms sprouted out of the modern internet, there were individuals writing about their trials and triuphs
      and sharing useful tutorials - bloggers. I can't count the number of times I've been rescued from frustration
      by the writings of some unknown programmer found on 'the Google'. I can only hope that something I write here
      will have the same impact for anyone.
