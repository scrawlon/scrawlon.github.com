This is a modern twist on the 'Magic 8 Ball' game. Ask a yes or no question.
Get a random answer. It seemed like a simple project for my first dive into
Alexa development, but it was quite challenging to create the conversational UI.

It would be boring if the app simply answered "yes" or "no". If you ask the
Hive Mind a question, you should get an answer with context. For example, launching
the app with "Ask the Hive Mind, Will I be famous?", gets a response like,
"The Hive Mind believes that you will." The question
"Are my friends going to the party", gets the response,
"The Hive Mind believes that they are not."

It takes a mix of training phrases and coding to get the nuanced response. If
I ask "will I" to hear back "you will". If I ask "are my friends" to hear
"they are".

During testing, I also experimented with

to give Alexa different voices and personalities. There's a lot of room to explore,
and I look forward to working on more Alexa voice UI projects in the near future.
