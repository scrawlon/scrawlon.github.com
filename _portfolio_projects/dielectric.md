Dielectric is one of Compulse's longest running web client's. In fact,
the site was hosted as static html pages on our old servers at
<a

title="Sinclair Digital Solutions" target="\_blank">Sinclair Digital Solutions before
Compulse Integrated Marketing existed as separate entity.</a>
Sinclair hosted hundreds of local network television affiliate landing pages on
those servers as well. A couple years ago they made the decision to take those servers
offline, so all of those sites needed to be moved.

It's a rare occasion that time and resources are extended to make improvements
in a large corporate ecosystem. Since the content needed to be moved, and that
required a lot of resources anyway, it made sense to use the opportunity to
make improvements. The Dielectric site was redesigned and moved to
WordPress.

This is where I started with this project.
We had to migrate the existing content over to WordPress, customize the theme and
create templates for the new design. On top of that, we would be implementing new
functionality. The WordPress CMS provides many options not available on the old
static server, so it made sense to take advantage of those for the new site.

I've been the main developer on the site ever since. Though the site is now largely
in maintenance mode, we still occasionally receive requests for new features.
