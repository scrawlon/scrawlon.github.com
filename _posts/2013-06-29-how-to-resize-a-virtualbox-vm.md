So, I recently found out what happens when a virtual machine
runs out of space. Just resize the hard drive, right? Intuitively, one might
think there'd be a button for that... There isn't.   

A little background: I'm on OS X 10.7.5 and VirtualBox 4.2.12

*** __Disclaimer:__ ** This could potentially destroy all data on your virtual
machine. Back up all your data, and proceed at your own risk.*

Here's how to do it:  
--------------------

1. Shut down the virtual machine you're trying to resize.

2. Open an OS X terminal window and navigate to the directory where your virtual
machine is. Mine is in "VirtualBox VMs/Ubuntu".

3. Clone the virtual hard drive, so you'll have a backup:  
`VBoxManage clonehd Your_virtual_machine.vdi clone.vdi`  
__If your vm is in .vmdk format, you need to convert to .vdi:__
`VBoxManage clonehd Your_virtual_machine.vmdk clone.vdi -format VDI`   
_You should see a progress bar. This will take at least a few minutes._

4. Resize the hard drive:  
`VBoxManage modifyhd clone.vdi --resize 20000`   
(Where the number is the new size in mb.)

5. Create a new virtual machine:
+ Go back to VirtualBox and click 'New'. Choose a new name and select the same OS and memory settings as the original.

+ At the 'Hard drive' screen, select 'use an existing virtual hard drive file'
and choose the file you created in step 4. Click 'Create'.

_The new machine will have all the installed programs and data as the original._

6. Repartition the hard drive:
+ Fortunately, someone has
already written an excellent guide:
[How To Enlarge a Virtual Machineâ€™s Disk in VirtualBox or VMware](http://www.howtogeek.com/124622/how-to-enlarge-a-virtual-machines-disk-in-virtualbox-or-vmware)
__- Skip about halfway down to the paragraph that begins "You can use a GParted live
CD..."__  
__TIP:__ If you're unable to resize your partition because there's a swap file in
the way, follow this guide:
[Expanding a Linux disk with gparted (and getting swap out of the way)](http://blog.mwpreston.net/2012/06/22/expanding-a-linux-disk-with-gparted-and-getting-swap-out-of-the-way/)

Virtualization is an amazing thing.
The ability to create customized, clonable, disposable virtual computing
environments is endlessly useful. If that interests you, stay tuned for my upcoming
post about [Vagrant](http://http://www.vagrantup.com/).
