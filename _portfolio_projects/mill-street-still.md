The client on this project requested a special floating navigation for the site.
On page load, the navigation links would be at the bottom of the screen. Scrolling
down would move the navigation up until it hit the top of the page where it would
stop. Once the navigation was at the top, the content below would flow under as
the user continued to scroll. The process would reverse if the user scrolled
back up again.

It took some time to work through the implementation on paper, but in the end,
I was able to make it work with a few lines of jQuery.
