        <h1>In the real world</h1>

        <p>
          I'm professional web developer. I write code for free snacks, coffee,
          the occassional pizza and the least amount of money possible.
          I guess it could be worse...
        </p>

        <p>
          Seriously though, it's great. I've done some interesting and rewarding
          work. Much of the code I blog about here, originated from larger projects
          at my day job.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've been fortunate to work with a creative and talented team of
          developers and web deisgners. Any project, no matter seemingly mundane,
          can be elevated
        </p>

        <p>
          I started late in life, after
          decades working in an entirely different industry.

          What is a Scrawlon? Is it a slang? Does it mean something rude????
          No. No. No. It was originally the name of long defunct web application I created
          -- kind of a cross between Twitter and Evernote, if you can imagine.
          Anyway, I always liked the sound of it. It's short and
          memorable, like a fictional computer hacker (Neo, Count Zero, Mr. Robot).
          Scrawlon has been my Internet moniker for many years now.
