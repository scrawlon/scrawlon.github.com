A brief bit about me: I studied journalism at university. 
I work in the engineering dept. at a network television station.

I've always wanted to be a programmer. Ever since we were allowed to tinker with
[BASIC] in a junior high computer class. Unfortunately, I was born at a time
when computers were only for the most mathetically-inclined whiz-kids. I and most others were barred
from the computer lab soon after. It wasn't for us.
[BASIC]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC, "BASIC"

I believed that until the recent appearance of free onilne education sites like:

* [MIT Open Courseware]
* [Coursera]
* [edX]
* [P2PU]

[MIT Open Courseware]: http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm "MIT Open Courseware"
[Coursera]: https://www.coursera.org "Coursera"
[edX]: https://www.edx.org/ "edX"
[P2PU]: https://p2pu.org/en/ "P2PU"

Thankfully, I and probably millions of others have found and explored an interest in programming this way.
It's an awesome time to be a learner, but before these self-contained, auto-graded, video-lectured virtual
class rooms sprouted out of the modern internet, there were individuals writing about their trials and triuphs
and sharing useful tutorials - bloggers. I can't count the number of times I've been rescued from frustration
by the writings of some unknown programmer found on 'the Google'. I can only hope that something I write here
will have the same impact for anyone.
