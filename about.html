    A brief bit about me: I studied journalism at university. 
    I work in the engineering dept. at a network television station.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've always wanted to be a programmer. Ever since we were allowed to tinker with
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a> in junior high computer class. 
    Unfortunately, at that time in history
    computer programming was only offered to the most mathematically-inclined whiz-kids. 
    I and most others were barred from the computer lab soon after. It wasn't for the rest of us.
  </p>

    I believed that until the recent appearance of free online education sites like:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm">MIT Open Courseware</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/">P2PU</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Thankfully, I and probably millions of others have found and explored an interest in programming this way.
    It's an awesome time to be a learner, but before these self-contained, auto-graded, video-lectured virtual
    class rooms sprouted out of the modern internet, there were individuals writing about their trials and triumphs
    and sharing useful tutorials - bloggers. I can't count the number of times I've been rescued from frustration
    by the writings of some unknown programmer found on 'the Google'. I can only hope that something I write here
    will have the same impact for anyone.
