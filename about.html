<p>
  The name "Scrawlon" came from one of my first web projects, a phone-based
  note-taking app from the pre-smartphone era. The idea was to text myself
  short notes that could be searched later on - kind of a cross between
  Twitter and Evernote. The app never fully materialized, but I liked the name so
  much that I've taken it as my online moniker.
