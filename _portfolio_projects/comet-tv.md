This site's main focus is to provide info on Comet's movies and television shows.
Early on in the development, I worked on integrating the programming data API,
caching the data and mapping it to fields in Laravel templates. The site now
displays a daily programming schedule with show times, show titles, episode names,
episode descriptions, photos, cast info and links to full show episode guides.
