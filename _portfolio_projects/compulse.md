Quite a few designers, developers, copywriters and SEO specialists
have collaborated on this web site.
It seems that everyone who has worked at Compulse has made some contribution to
the company web site, and it may be the most important example our work.
This is the page that contains the
<a href="http://compulse.com/our-work/"
title="Compulse portfolio page" target="\_blank">Compulse portfolio page</a>,
so oddly enough, this design matters more than the sites in the portfolio.

For my part, I worked on the
<a
href="http://compulse.com/category/blog/"
title="Blog pages"
target="\_blank">Blog pages</a> and
<a href="http://events.compulse.com/"
title="Compulse Events pages" target="\_blank">Compulse Events pages</a>,
as well as creating custom Wordpress templates, plugins, post types for the site.

Several designers independently created the page mockups and collected the
functional requirements from management. I used that to created that actual pages
and push that code to the live site. This is the typical designer/developer workflow
at Compulse.
