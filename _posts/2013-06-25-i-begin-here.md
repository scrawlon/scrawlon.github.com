I'm no expert. Since I made the decision to become a programmer, I've
spent countless hours of frustration - stuck - just trying to make my code perform
the most basic functions. What's worse, is in the beginning I often didn't know enough developer
jargon to even search for the answers.

Invariably (after hours, days, weeks of searching), I would happen upon some random developer's personal blog,
and find the answer. Those bloggers kept me floating in the early days, so I made
myself a promise: if I get stuck on something and find a solution, I'll blog
about it. That way some frustrated programmer might someday find it.

I lied (to myself)! I've been stuck many times, found many solutions, and
never wrote a word. Until now.

Hope this helps.
